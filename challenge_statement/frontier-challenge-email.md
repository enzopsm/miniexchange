Hey Enzo,

This is awesome! Thanks for making yourself available.

Attached to this email is the take-home. Just to be clear, you don't need to send it back in two days! We expect it to take around 2–3 days of work, but we know you have a lot of responsibilities, so take your time. Important: One of the goals of this challenge is to help us understand how we would work together, so asking us questions when you need to is good and encouraged. Please reach out to me here or via WhatsApp (+1 650 402-9797) with any questions you might have.

Let’s find a time for you to come to the office next week and present your solution. You only need to send it the day before you present, so you’ll have around 7 days total to work on it.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
